# Shipping Fee

Write a function `shipping(individual_costs)` that processes the cost of shipping for an order from an online store. 
It should **return** the cost of shipping. The individual cost of shipping is 100

The cost of shipping is calculated as the most expensive individual cost plus a $2.50 fee for all other items.
If there are no items then shipping costs $0.00

No rounding necessary
